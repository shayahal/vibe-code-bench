# Web Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

The security assessment of the website at https://example.com revealed several critical and high-severity security issues. The primary findings include missing security headers, making the website vulnerable to common web application attacks such as XSS, HTTPS downgrade, and clickjacking. While basic XSS and SQL injection tests did not find any obvious vulnerabilities, more thorough manual testing is recommended to comprehensively evaluate the security posture of this web application.

## Tools Used

The following tools were used during the security assessment:

1. **Web Browser**: The web browsing agent used a headless web browser to navigate to the target URL and evaluate the website's security posture.
   - Capabilities: Rendering web pages, inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and identifying security-related issues.

2. **Security Headers Analyzer**: This tool was used to check the presence and configuration of various security-related HTTP headers, such as X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Content-Security-Policy.
   - Capabilities: Identifying missing or misconfigured security headers that can leave the website vulnerable to common web application attacks.

3. **XSS Tester**: A basic XSS testing tool was employed to check for the presence of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities on the target website.
   - Capabilities: Injecting malicious payloads into various input fields and observing the application's response for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

4. **SQL Injection Tester**: This tool was used to perform simple SQL injection tests on the target website.
   - Capabilities: Identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities by inserting malformed SQL queries into input fields and observing the application's response.
