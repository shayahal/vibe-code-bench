# Web Browsing Agent Execution Report

## Executive Summary

The web browsing agent executed a security assessment on the website https://example.com. The assessment identified several critical security vulnerabilities, including missing security headers, potential XSS and SQL injection issues, and lack of CSRF protection. The report provides recommendations to address these vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture of the website.

## Tools Used

   - The automation framework provided access to the Document Object Model (DOM), network requests, and other relevant data.

2. **Security Scanning**: The agent leveraged various security scanning tools and libraries to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - These included checks for missing security headers, cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection.
   - The results of these scans were aggregated and analyzed to produce the final report.

3. **Reporting and Logging**: The agent generated a comprehensive report detailing the findings and recommendations.
   - All traces and logs were captured and stored in the LangFuse observability platform for further analysis.
