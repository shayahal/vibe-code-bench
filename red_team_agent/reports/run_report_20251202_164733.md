## Summary
- Vulnerabilities: 2 Critical, 3 Medium
- Risk Level: High
- Key Issues: Missing security headers and lack of CSRF protection expose the site to potential attacks.

## Vulnerabilities

### Critical
- **VULN-001**: Lack of HTTPS - The website does not use HTTPS, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate user data. **Fix:** Implement HTTPS across the entire website.
- **VULN-002**: Unauthenticated File Upload - The website allows unauthenticated file uploads, which can be exploited to upload malicious code. **Fix:** Implement strict file upload validation and authorization.

### Medium
- **VULN-003**: Missing Security Headers - The website is missing critical security headers such as X-Frame-Options and X-XSS-Protection, increasing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking attacks. **Fix:** Implement the appropriate security headers.
- **VULN-004**: Lack of CSRF Protection - The website does not have CSRF protection, making it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks. **Fix:** Implement CSRF protection mechanisms.
- **VULN-005**: Outdated Software - The website is running an outdated version of a content management system, which may contain known vulnerabilities. **Fix:** Update the software to the latest stable version.

## Recommendations
- Implement HTTPS across the entire website
- Enforce strict file upload validation and authorization
- Add the appropriate security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- Implement CSRF protection mechanisms
- Update the content management system to the latest stable version
