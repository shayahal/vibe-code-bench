# RIPER Workflow - Development Cycle

## Overview
RIPER is a structured workflow for ongoing development that prevents unintended modifications while maintaining continuity across coding sessions. The workflow consists of five phases that cycle as needed.

## Workflow Phases

### R - Research
**Purpose**: Gather information and understand existing code

**Activities**:
- Read and analyze existing codebase
- Understand requirements and constraints
- Identify dependencies and relationships
- Document findings
- Ask clarifying questions

**Output**: Research notes and understanding

**When to Use**: 
- Starting a new feature
- Debugging issues
- Understanding legacy code
- Before making changes

---

### I - Innovate
**Purpose**: Brainstorm potential approaches and solutions

**Activities**:
- Generate multiple solution approaches
- Evaluate pros and cons
- Consider alternatives
- Think creatively
- Explore new patterns or techniques

**Output**: Multiple solution options

**When to Use**:
- After research phase
- When stuck on a problem
- When optimizing existing code
- Before planning implementation

---

### P - Plan
**Purpose**: Create detailed technical specifications

**Activities**:
- Select best approach from innovation phase
- Break down into tasks
- Define interfaces and APIs
- Plan data structures
- Create implementation steps
- Identify risks and mitigation

**Output**: Detailed implementation plan

**When to Use**:
- After innovation phase
- Before writing code
- When refactoring
- When adding features

---

### E - Execute
**Purpose**: Implement approved plans with precision

**Activities**:
- Write code according to plan
- Follow coding standards
- Write tests alongside code
- Commit frequently
- Document as you go
- Stay focused on the plan

**Output**: Implemented code

**When to Use**:
- After planning phase
- When plan is approved
- During active development

---

### Rev - Review
**Purpose**: Validate implementation against plans

**Activities**:
- Compare implementation to plan
- Run tests and verify functionality
- Check code quality
- Review for bugs
- Update documentation
- Get feedback

**Output**: Validated implementation

**When to Use**:
- After execution phase
- Before marking complete
- When testing
- During code review

---

## Workflow Flow

```
Research → Innovate → Plan → Execute → Review
   ↑                                        ↓
   └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The workflow can loop back to Research if:
- Review reveals gaps in understanding
- New requirements emerge
- Implementation needs rethinking

---

## State Management

**Current Phase**: Track which phase you're in
**Previous Phase**: Remember where you came from
**Next Phase**: Know where you're going
**Blockers**: Document what's preventing progress

---

## Memory Integration

Each phase should:
- Update memory bank with findings
- Reference previous decisions
- Document new patterns
- Learn from experience

---

## Commands

- `/riper` - Show current RIPER status
- `/research` - Enter research phase
- `/innovate` - Enter innovate phase
- `/plan` - Enter plan phase
- `/execute` - Enter execute phase
- `/review` - Enter review phase
- `/next` - Move to next phase
- `/back` - Return to previous phase

---

## Best Practices

1. **Complete each phase** before moving to the next
2. **Document decisions** in memory bank
3. **Stay in phase** - don't skip ahead
4. **Review often** - catch issues early
5. **Loop back** when needed - it's okay to research again

---

## Phase Transitions

**Research → Innovate**: When you understand the problem
**Innovate → Plan**: When you have solution options
**Plan → Execute**: When plan is detailed and approved
**Execute → Review**: When implementation is complete
**Review → Research**: When gaps are found or new work needed
