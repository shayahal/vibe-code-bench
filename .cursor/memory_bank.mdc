# Memory Bank - Persistent Project Knowledge

## Overview
The Memory Bank is a persistent knowledge system that maintains context, decisions, patterns, and learnings across coding sessions. It prevents information loss and enables continuity.

## Structure

### 1. Project Context
**Purpose**: Maintain high-level project understanding

**Contains**:
- Project goals and objectives
- Key stakeholders
- Business context
- Success metrics
- Current state

**Update Frequency**: When project goals change

---

### 2. Decision Log
**Purpose**: Track important decisions and rationale

**Format**:
```
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Decision: [What was decided]
Rationale: [Why this decision]
Alternatives: [What else was considered]
Impact: [What this affects]
```

**Update Frequency**: After each significant decision

---

### 3. Pattern Library
**Purpose**: Document reusable patterns and solutions

**Contains**:
- Code patterns that work well
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Common solutions
- Best practices
- Code snippets

**Update Frequency**: When discovering new patterns

---

### 4. Architecture Decisions
**Purpose**: Document architectural choices

**Contains**:
- System architecture
- Component designs
- Data models
- API designs
- Integration patterns

**Update Frequency**: When architecture changes

---

### 5. Technical Debt
**Purpose**: Track known issues and improvements

**Contains**:
- Known bugs
- Refactoring needs
- Performance issues
- Security concerns
- Documentation gaps

**Update Frequency**: When debt is identified or resolved

---

### 6. Learning Log
**Purpose**: Capture insights and learnings

**Contains**:
- What worked well
- What didn't work
- Lessons learned
- Gotchas and pitfalls
- Tips and tricks

**Update Frequency**: After completing features or fixing issues

---

### 7. Code Relationships
**Purpose**: Map dependencies and relationships

**Contains**:
- Module dependencies
- Data flows
- Call graphs
- Integration points
- External dependencies

**Update Frequency**: When structure changes

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Update
- After completing a feature
- After making important decisions
- When discovering patterns
- When encountering issues
- At end of coding session

### What to Document
- **Decisions**: Why, not just what
- **Patterns**: Reusable solutions
- **Context**: Background information
- **Relationships**: How things connect
- **Learnings**: Insights and discoveries

### How to Organize
- Use clear headings
- Date entries
- Cross-reference related items
- Keep it searchable
- Update, don't duplicate

---

## Memory Bank Commands

- `/memory` - Show memory bank status
- `/memory add` - Add new entry
- `/memory search [term]` - Search memory bank
- `/memory decision` - Log a decision
- `/memory pattern` - Document a pattern
- `/memory learn` - Add a learning
- `/memory debt` - Track technical debt

---

## Integration with RIPER

**Research Phase**: Read from memory bank
**Innovate Phase**: Reference past patterns
**Plan Phase**: Consider previous decisions
**Execute Phase**: Follow documented patterns
**Review Phase**: Update memory bank

## Example Entries

### Decision Log Entry
```
Date: 2025-01-15
Decision: Use LangChain for agent orchestration
Rationale: Provides built-in agent framework, tool integration, and async support
Alternatives: Custom implementation, other frameworks
Impact: All agent implementations, tool integrations
```

### Pattern Entry
```
Pattern: Agent Tool Creation
Context: Creating tools for LangChain agents
Code:
  @tool
  def my_tool(input: str) -> str:
      """Tool description."""
      return result
When to Use: When creating reusable agent capabilities
```

### Learning Entry
```
Date: 2025-01-15
Learning: LangChain agents need explicit tool descriptions
Context: Agent wasn't using tools correctly
Solution: Added detailed descriptions to all tools
Application: All future tool definitions
```

## Maintenance

**Regular Review**: Weekly review of memory bank
**Cleanup**: Remove outdated information
**Organization**: Keep structure consistent
**Accessibility**: Make it easy to find information
