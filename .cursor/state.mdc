# State Management - Track Current Status

## Current State

### Project Phase
**Status**: [START / RIPER]
**Current Step**: [Which step/phase]
**Started**: [Date/Time]

---

### RIPER Workflow State
**Current Phase**: [Research / Innovate / Plan / Execute / Review]
**Previous Phase**: [Previous phase]
**Next Phase**: [Next phase]
**Phase Started**: [Date/Time]

---

### Active Tasks
**Current Task**: [What you're working on]
**Task Status**: [In Progress / Blocked / Complete]
**Blockers**: [What's preventing progress]

---

### Context
**Current Focus**: [What you're focusing on]
**Recent Changes**: [What was just changed]
**Next Steps**: [What comes next]

---

## State Transitions

### Phase Changes
When moving between phases:
1. Document current state
2. Record transition reason
3. Update timestamps
4. Clear blockers if resolved

### Task Changes
When task status changes:
1. Update status
2. Record completion/blocker
3. Update timestamps
4. Note next action

---

## State Commands

- `/state` - Show current state
- `/state phase [phase]` - Set current phase
- `/state task [task]` - Set current task
- `/state blocker [issue]` - Add blocker
- `/state clear` - Clear current state
- `/state save` - Save state snapshot

---

## State Persistence

State is saved to:
- `.cursor/state.mdc` - Current state
- `.cursor/history/` - State history
- Memory bank - Important state transitions

---

## State Recovery

If interrupted:
1. Check `.cursor/state.mdc`
2. Review recent memory bank entries
3. Check git history
4. Review recent files

## Example States

### START Phase State
```
Project Phase: START
Current Step: Architecture
Started: 2025-01-15 10:00
Active Tasks: Designing system architecture
Blockers: None
```

### RIPER Workflow State
```
Current Phase: Execute
Previous Phase: Plan
Next Phase: Review
Phase Started: 2025-01-15 14:30
Current Task: Implementing logging system
Task Status: In Progress
Blockers: None
```

## Best Practices

1. **Update state frequently** - Don't lose context
2. **Be specific** - Clear task descriptions
3. **Document blockers** - Know what's preventing progress
4. **Save before breaks** - Don't lose state
5. **Review state** - Start sessions by checking state
