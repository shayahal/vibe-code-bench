# START Phase - Project Initialization

## Overview
The START phase is a one-time initialization process that sets up your project structure, defines requirements, and establishes the memory bank. This phase should be completed before beginning the RIPER workflow.

## Phase Steps

### 1. Requirements (S1)
**Purpose**: Define what needs to be built

**Questions to Answer**:
- What is the project's primary goal?
- What are the core features and functionalities?
- What are the success criteria?
- What are the constraints and limitations?
- Who are the stakeholders?

**Output**: Requirements document

---

### 2. Technology (S2)
**Purpose**: Select appropriate technologies and tools

**Questions to Answer**:
- What programming languages are needed?
- What frameworks and libraries will be used?
- What databases or storage solutions?
- What external services or APIs?
- What development tools and environments?

**Output**: Technology stack document

---

### 3. Architecture (S3)
**Purpose**: Design the system architecture

**Questions to Answer**:
- What is the overall system architecture?
- How are components organized?
- What are the key design patterns?
- How do components communicate?
- What are the data flows?

**Output**: Architecture diagram and documentation

---

### 4. Scaffolding (S4)
**Purpose**: Create the initial project structure

**Tasks**:
- Create directory structure
- Set up configuration files
- Initialize version control
- Create initial boilerplate code
- Set up build and deployment scripts

**Output**: Project scaffold

---

### 5. Environment (S5)
**Purpose**: Configure development and deployment environments

**Tasks**:
- Set up development environment
- Configure testing environment
- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Configure production environment
- Document environment setup

**Output**: Environment configuration

---

### 6. Memory Bank (S6)
**Purpose**: Initialize persistent memory system

**Tasks**:
- Create memory bank structure
- Document project context
- Set up knowledge base
- Create decision log
- Initialize pattern library

**Output**: Memory bank initialized

---

## Completion Criteria

The START phase is complete when:
- ✅ All requirements are documented
- ✅ Technology stack is selected
- ✅ Architecture is designed
- ✅ Project scaffold is created
- ✅ Environments are configured
- ✅ Memory bank is initialized

---

## Next Steps

After completing START phase, proceed to the RIPER workflow:
1. Research
2. Innovate
3. Plan
4. Execute
5. Review
